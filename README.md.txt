## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
The BoomBike want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
	- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	- How well those variables describe the bike demands
The business goal is to model the demand for shared bike using available data.

## Conclusions
- The demand for the shared bikes can be modelled approximately by linear regression analysis. 
- Among the categorical variables weather conditions, seasons or months, and year has significant impact on the demand for the shared bikes.
- Among numeric variables only temp or atemp (actual temperature) influences the deamnd for shared bikes to considerable extent.
- The demand for casual users and registered users should be modelled separately to better understand the impact of the demand
- Further information is needed to understand why demand in 2019 is higher than 2018.
